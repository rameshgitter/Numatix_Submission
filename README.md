# Multi-Timeframe Trading Strategy

A sophisticated trading system that implements a multi-timeframe strategy using Python, with both backtesting and live trading capabilities on Binance Testnet.

## Project Overview

This project implements a trading strategy that combines multiple timeframes (15-minute entries with 1-hour confirmations) to make trading decisions. The system includes both backtesting capabilities using `backtesting.py` and live trading functionality through Binance Testnet API.

### Key Features

- Multi-timeframe strategy implementation (15m entries, 1h confirmations)
- Comprehensive backtesting system with detailed trade logging
- Live trading integration with Binance Testnet
- Trade comparison and analysis tools
- Modular, class-based architecture for maintainability and extensibility

## Strategy Details

The strategy combines signals from two timeframes:
- 15-minute timeframe for entry signals
- 1-hour timeframe for trade confirmation

Key components:
- Entry signals generated on 15m timeframe
- Trade confirmation using 1h timeframe indicators
- Risk management rules implemented at both timeframes
- Position sizing based on volatility and account equity

## Trade Logging

Both backtest and live trades are logged with:
- Timestamp
- Trade direction (long/short)
- Entry price
- Exit price
- Position size
- PnL
- Additional metadata

## Usage

### 1. Setup
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run Backtest
Executes the strategy on historical data and saves trades to `data/backtest_trades.csv`.
```bash
python3 backtest.py
```

### 3. Run Live Trading
Starts the live trading bot on Binance Testnet. Logs trades to `data/live_trades.csv`.
```bash
python3 live_trading.py
```
> **Tip**: Run this for **1-2 hours** or wait until you see at least one "Position OPENED" log message. This ensures you have data to verify against the backtest.

### 4. Verify Parity
Compares backtest and live trades to ensure logic consistency.
```bash
python3 trade_matching.py
```

## Development Guidelines

- Document all classes and methods
- Use logging for debugging and monitoring

## Dependencies

Key packages used:
- backtesting.py
- python-binance
- pandas
- numpy
- ta (Technical Analysis library)
- python-dotenv

## Notes

- Always test thoroughly on Binance Testnet before live deployment
- Monitor trade execution latency
- Regularly validate strategy performance
- Keep API keys secure and never commit them to version control
